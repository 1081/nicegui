# Serving app behind reverse proxy subpath

This demo shows how to serve NiceGUI on a subpath behind a reverse proxy.
Here we use Nginx. For a Traeffic demo have a look at https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/docker-compose.yml.

## Try Out

Just run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then you can access http://localhost/nicegui.
